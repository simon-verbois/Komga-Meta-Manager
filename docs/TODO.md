# Komga Meta Manager - Future Development Roadmap

## üéØ High Priority Features

### 1. MangaDex Provider Integration
**Goal:** Add MangaDex as an alternative metadata provider to AniList

**Why:** Provides broader coverage for Western-style comics and offers different data quality
**Implementation:**
- Create `modules/providers/mangadex.py` extending `BaseProvider`
- Add MangaDex API integration with GraphQL or REST API
- Support for chapters, volumes, and series metadata
- Update provider factory in `__init__.py`
- Add `mangadex` option to provider configuration

**Expected Impact:** More comprehensive metadata for certain content types

---

### 2. Advanced Cover Image Overlays
**Goal:** Implement an overlay system for cover images (watermarks, logos, text overlays)

**Why:** Many users want branded covers or informational overlays
**Implementation:**
- Add image processing capabilities (extend Pillow usage)
- Create overlay configuration section in config.yml
- Support for PNG overlays, text overlays, and positioning
- Add `cover_overlay` field to processing configuration

**Expected Impact:** Enhanced cover aesthetics and personalization

---

### 3. Multi-Language Title Matching System
**Goal:** Improve series matching regardless of input language

**Why:** Current system is English/Romanji-centric, fails with non-Latin titles
**Implementation:**
- Implement language detection for input titles
- Add fallback matching using transliteration APIs
- Enhance fuzzy matching with language-aware algorithms
- Consider ML-based title normalization (future)

**Expected Impact:** Better matching accuracy, especially for Asian languages

---

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
**Goal:** Improve debugging capabilities with structured, detailed logs

**Why:** Current debug mode lacks depth for troubleshooting complex scenarios
**Implementation:**
- Add granular logging levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO+)
- Implement structured logging with context (request IDs, timing)
- Add performance profiling logs
- Create debug-specific endpoints for cache inspection

**Expected Impact:** Easier troubleshooting and maintenance

---

## üîß Dependency & Security Updates

### 5. Dependency Modernization
**Status:** Critical Security Update Required

**Issues:**
- `requests==2.31.0` has known vulnerabilities, should upgrade to 2.32+
- Unpinned packages (`deepl`, `thefuzz`) risk version conflicts

**Implementation:**
- Audit all dependencies for CVEs
- Update to latest stable versions with compatibility testing
- Add version constraints in requirements.txt
- Consider dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

**Expected Impact:** Improved security and stability

---

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### 6. API Call Optimization
**Goal:** Reduce API overhead and improve throughput

**Current Issues:**
- Separate PATCH requests for each metadata field
- Potential for batch operations

**Implementation:**
- Implement batch PATCH operations where Komga API supports it
- Add request coalescing for similar operations
- Optimize retry logic to avoid unnecessary delays

**Expected Impact:** 30-50% reduction in API call volume

---

### 7. Cache System Improvements
**Goal:** More efficient caching with better memory management

**Implementation:**
- Add configurable TTL (Time To Live) per cache type
- Implement cache size limits and LRU eviction
- Add cache compression for translation data
- Better persistence with atomic saves

**Expected Impact:** Reduced memory usage, faster lookups

---

### 8. Algorithm Optimizations
**Goal:** Optimize computational bottlenecks

**Targets:**
- `choose_best_match()`: Replace list comprehensions with generators
- Translation cache: Use more efficient data structures
- Series processing: Parallel processing for independent operations

**Expected Impact:** 20-40% performance improvement

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Robustness Enhancements

### 9. Testing Infrastructure
**Goal:** Add comprehensive testing (despite previous removal)

**Why:** Code without tests is fragile and error-prone
**Implementation:**
- Add integration tests for critical paths
- Unit tests for `komga_client.py` and core logic
- API mocking for external services
- Test coverage reporting and minimum thresholds

**Expected Impact:** Higher code reliability and easier maintenance

---

### 10. Error Handling Expansion
**Goal:** More comprehensive error recovery

**Areas to Improve:**
- Network timeouts and connection pooling
- Schema validation for external APIs
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Better error classification for metrics

**Expected Impact:** Improved stability and user experience

---

### 11. Configuration Validation
**Goal:** Stricter configuration checking

**Implementation:**
- Add runtime validation beyond Pydantic models
- Cross-parameter validation (e.g., conflicting settings)
- Startup health checks for external services
- Configuration migration support for new versions

**Expected Impact:** Fewer runtime errors from misconfigurations

---

## üèóÔ∏è Code Quality & Developer Experience

### 12. Code Quality Tools
**Goal:** Add automated code quality enforcement

**Tools to Implement:**
- **black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting and style checking
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **pre-commit hooks**: Automated formatting and checks

**Implementation:** Add configuration files and CI integration

**Expected Impact:** Consistent, maintainable codebase

---

### 13. Documentation Improvements
**Goal:** Enhance code and API documentation

**Areas:**
- Add docstrings to complex functions in `processor.py`
- API endpoint documentation
- Configuration schema docs
- Developer onboarding guide

**Expected Impact:** Easier contribution and maintenance

---

### 14. Advanced Monitoring & Metrics
**Goal:** Deeper observability

**Features:**
- Prometheus-compatible metrics export
- Custom Grafana dashboards
- Performance profiling integration
- Alerting on business metrics (success rates, coverages)

**Expected Impact:** Better operational visibility and optimization
